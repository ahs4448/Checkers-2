This is a game im working on in javascript and theres no cpu functionality yet.It is almost complete but I need to do the following:

implement logjam algorithm

prevent inelegible pieces from being able to be selected

prevent inelegible spots on the board from being picked for a move or skip

implement unselecting feature

implement additional skip highlighter on spots eligible for additional skips

add score keeping and win or lose logic.

React version coming soon
